= springboot-kafka-websocket

The goal of this project is to implement two https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/htmlsingle/[`String Boot`] applications: `bitcoin-api` and `bitcoin-client`. The `bitcoin-api` application simulates `BTC` price changes, while the `bitcoin-client` application listens to these changes and updates a real-time UI. The `bitcoin-client` UI is secured using Basic Authentication.

== Proof-of-Concepts & Articles

On https://ivangfr.github.io:[ivangfr.github.io], I have compiled my Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) and articles. You can easily search for the technology you are interested in by using the filter. Who knows, perhaps I have already implemented a PoC or written an article about what you are looking for.

== Applications

* *bitcoin-api*
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application service that simulates `BTC` price changes and pushes those changes to https://kafka.apache.org/[`Kafka`]

* *bitcoin-client*
+
`Spring Boot` Web Java application that was implemented using `Thymeleaf` as HTML template. It reads from `Kafka` and updates its UI using `Websocket`. It has also a chat where users can talk to each other, by sending messages publicly or privately.

== Prerequisites

* https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17[`Java 17+`]
* https://www.docker.com/[`Docker`]

== Start Environment

* Open a terminal and inside `springboot-kafka-websocket` root folder run:
+
[source]
----
docker compose up -d
----

* Wait for Docker containers to be up and running. To check it, run:
+
[source]
----
docker compose ps
----

== Running applications with Maven

Inside `springboot-kafka-websocket` root folder, run the following `Maven` commands in different terminals:

* *bitcoin-api*
+
[source]
----
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects bitcoin-api -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9081"
----

* *bitcoin-client*
+
[source]
----
./mvnw clean spring-boot:run --projects bitcoin-client -Dspring-boot.run.jvmArguments="-Dserver.port=9082"
----

== Running Applications as Docker containers
